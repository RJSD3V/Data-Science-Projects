# These Are My Data Science Projects:

The start of my data science journey (doing actual projects) was a bit late. I have been contemplating over theory for a long time now. And as a student of Computer Science, I decided one day to actually get my hands dirty and start doing some projects and begin experimenting with data sets to see how far I can get without breaking. 

Im going to target one project (or more) for each package, to get used to the rythm of making and using numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn and seaborn , etc. Instances and objects


 You could refer to one of this projects in order to replicate them, in order to get a hand on python data science stuff yourself, theyre all open source projects that other people have done, and I have done them by reading other people's code as well, so you can too.


What I also stress on time and again is the theory, the math, behind all of this, for which I always go on and off on actively doing projects to going and reading some theory.
