# These Are My Data Science Projects:

## The start of my data science journey (doing actual projects) was a bit late. I have been contemplating over theory for a long time now. And as a student of Computer Science, I decided one day to actually get my hands dirty and start doing some projects and begin experimenting with data sets to see how far I can get without breaking. 

## Im going to target one project (or more) for each package, to get used to the rythm of making and using numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn and seaborn , etc. Instances and objects
